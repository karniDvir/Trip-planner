<h1>description</h1> 
<p> 
The Travel Planner application is designed to help users organize their trips effectively.
Built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, it allows users to create, manage, and share trip plans. 
Users can specify trip details such as start and end dates, add hotels and activities for each day of their trip, and view trip summaries. 
The application features user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to trip plans.
It leverages Spring Security for managing user sessions and includes data persistence using Hibernate and MySQL database.
This project demonstrates practical use of Java web development technologies for creating a robust travel planning tool.
